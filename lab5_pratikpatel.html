
To complete Lab 5 as described, you'll need to follow several steps involving creating a new repository on GitHub, adding an HTML file, setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, and then submitting your work on Blackboard. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Create a New Repository for Lab 5
Log in to your GitHub account.
Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
Name the repository (e.g., "lab5-yourfullname").
Initialize the repository with a README file (optional).
Create the repository.
Step 2: Add a New HTML File
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Create a new HTML file named lab5_yourfullname.html.
Add content to the HTML file. This could be a basic HTML structure with some personal information or course-related content.
Commit the file to your local repository and push it to GitHub.
Step 3: Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
In your GitHub repository, create a new file in the .github/workflows directory.

Name it something like ci-cd.yml.

Add the CI/CD code to this file. Hereâ€™s a basic example of what the code might look like:

yaml
Copy code
name: Deploy to FTP Server

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: FTP Deploy
      uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@4.0.0
      with:
        ftp-server: ftp://shivaprogramming.com/
        ftp-username: ${{ secrets.ftp_username }}
        ftp-password: ${{ secrets.ftp_password }}
        local-dir: public/
